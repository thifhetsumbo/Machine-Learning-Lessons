"""At the bottom of your file, write a comment about two entities that you looked up. For each entity answer the following questions:

What was the entity and its explanation that you looked up?

Did the entity make sense in terms of the word associated with it

Entity 1:

Mary is identified as a person, which makes sense. "Mary" is a proper name for an individual, so labelling it as a PERSON is entirely appropriate and expected. SpaCy correctly recognises it as a named entity referring to a human.

Entity 2:

Mississippi is categorised as a GPE, which stands for "Geopolitical Entity." SpaCy defines a GPE as encompassing countries, cities, and states. This classification is appropriate because, in the sentence, "The cotton clothing is made of cotton that grows in Mississippi," "Mississippi" refers to a U.S. state, which is indeed a geopolitical location. Thus, SpaCy correctly identifies it as a GPE.
